# üîê Dr. Gianluigi "Zane" Zanettini SSH keys

Do you need to let me on your Linux server? Just run this script! It will create a `zane` user account and authorize my private SSH key to connect:

````bash
sudo apt install curl -y && curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZaneCEO/ssh-keys/main/allow-zane-as-zane.sh?$(date +%s) | sudo bash

````

You're done! You can close this page now üòâ


## Alternative (not recommended): Allow me to connect as root

‚ö† you DO NOT need this if you ran the previous command.

The following command will authorize my private SSH key to connect to the `root` account directly. 
It's a security hazard and I don't like it, so please prefer the previous command if possible.

````bash
sudo apt install curl -y && curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZaneCEO/ssh-keys/main/allow-zane-as-root.sh?$(date +%s) | sudo bash

````


## Extra: allow me to sudo without the password

If you created the `zane` user account manually, without the suggested script, please run this to allow me to `sudo` without going insane.

````bash
sudo apt install curl -y && curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZaneCEO/ssh-keys/main/sudoer.sh?$(date +%s) | sudo bash

````
